      <h2>Who We Are</h2>
      <p>
        Vacant House Guy is a <strong>Veteran-owned, family-run business</strong> that buys unwanted houses in 
        <strong>Central New York</strong>, <strong>Knoxville, TN</strong>, <strong>Charlotte, NC</strong>, and <strong>Colorado Springs, CO</strong>. 
        Whether you’ve inherited a property, have a house that got away from you, or are just done dealing with a vacant place — we want to hear from you.
      </p>
      <p>
        We're not a big faceless company. We're real people who understand that sometimes life changes, and a house doesn’t fit anymore. 
        We buy properties in all kinds of shape — from complete tear-downs to turnkey homes. If you’re holding onto a headache, let us make you an offer.

      <h2>How It Works</h2>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>You fill out a short form</strong> with the basics about the property (address, condition, your contact info).</li>
        <li><strong>We take a look</strong> — either personally or through someone we trust — usually within 48 hours.</li>
        <li><strong>If it's a fit</strong>, we make you a fair offer. There's <em>no obligation</em>, and we never sell your data.</li>
      </ol>
